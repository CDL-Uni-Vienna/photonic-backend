    # adjust logic for waveplate assignment for Qubit
    # function that "measure_x": rotates waveplates and reads pm for a certain time
    # set of 6 functions that measure the whole set of parameters needed for the tomography
    # with this 6 functions we will implement a function do_tomography
    # X, Y, Z, measure gates, and then do tomography
